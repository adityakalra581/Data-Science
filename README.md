# Data-Science
Tutorials of different ML algorithms and Data science methodologies.

## Capstone File:
This Jupyter notebook is developed in IBM Watson Studio as a part of Capstone project of course Machine Learning with Python by IBM on Coursera.
The project includes the problem to predict the Loan Status of the customers using the basic details.

### Models Used:
1. K- Nearest Neighbour(KNN)

2. Decision Tree Classifier

3. Logistic Regression

4. Support Vector Machine Classifier(SVM)

## Churn Prediction Model:

This Business problem was done to predict whether the existing customer will churn or not using the Basic Information like Partners,Dependents etc.

The notebook is self Explanatory and the dataset is provided in the below mentioned Google Drive link:

The link contains the dataset and the instructions came with it.

I am not aware of the original source of the dataset.

All credits of the dataset goes to https://www.insaid.co/ as the assignment is provided by them.

** This project is only for educational purpose only**

The notebook is divided into 4 parts:

1. Data Understanding and Manipulation

2. Data Visualization

3. Machine Learning Models

4. Evaluation of the Built Models and Conclusion.
