# Data-Science

Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data mining and big data.

DEEP LEARNING --> MACHINE LEARNING --> ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

All comes under **DATA SCIENCE**

**This Repository is primarily concerned for the above mentioned categories and 
not so much in Data Analysis and Visualization for now.**

## Machine Learning

- Machine learning is a Subset of artificial intelligence that provides machines/systems the ability to learn and improve from past experience.

- The Primary raw material for Machine Learning is Quality data.

- Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

## Deep Learning


- Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. 

- Also known as deep neural learning or deep neural network.
