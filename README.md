### 2. [Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/adityakalra581/Data-Science/tree/master/Deep%20Learning/Convolutional-Neural-Networks/Neural-Style-Transfer):

- Neural Style Transfer refers to a class of software algorithms that manipulate digital images, or videos, in order to adopt the appearance or visual style of another image. NST algorithms are characterized by their use of deep neural networks for the sake of image transformation.

### 3. [Classical Indian Dance Multi-class Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/aditya48/indian-dance-classification):

**Problem Statement:**  Build an image tagging Deep Learning model that can help the company classify these images into eight categories of Indian classical dance.
The dataset consists of 364 images belonging to 8 categories, namely manipuri, bharatanatyam, odissi, kathakali, kathak, sattriya, kuchipudi, and mohiniyattam.

- The 8 Categories looked something like this.
